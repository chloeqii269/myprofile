    <h2> SECONDARY SCHOOL EXPERIENCE </h2>
    <p> 
        I'm studied at <b> SMK SACRED HEART </b>, where I spent several important years 
        shaping my character,mindset and interests. My secondary school journey was 
        not only about academic learning, but also personal development through various 
        experiences and challenges.

    </ul>

    <p> Balancing studies with school activities helped me become more organized 
        and independent. These skills later became very useful in my further studies
        and daily life.

        competitions also taught me perseverance, discipline, and effective
        time management.
